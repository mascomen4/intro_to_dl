# Introduction to Deep Learning course resources
https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning

# This is one of the courses in the specialization "Advanced Machine Learning"
My contributions: 
I did the exercises that I supposed to do in the course. Additionally I understood the the rest of the code in the exercises so that I'm able to perform not only 
the model fittind and training but also: 
1. Processing input data so it can be in appropriate form for the Neural Network
2. Evaluating the model results
3. Analysing Neural Network filters and visualizing them to undestand what each and every layer in the Neural Network does.

## Week 1 - Linear models and optimizations.
Implementing Linear models with SGD. Adding Momentum to SGD and RMSProp for the gradients optimization.

## Week 2 - Neural Network built with Numpy library.
1. Manual implenent of the Dense layer.
2. Implementation of the forward propagation and back propagation. 
3. Implementation of the loss function.

## Week 3 - Convolutional Neural Network. 
1. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset implement the CNN using Keras library.
2. Fine-tuning of ImageNet for my own tasks. 

## Week 4.
1. Autoencoders 
2. Adversarial

## Week 5. 
1. RNN
